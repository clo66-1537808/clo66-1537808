	<h1>Newbie</h1>
	<p id="firstParagraph">
		My family goes to Chelan every year. I have been going since I was 8 months old. We camp in tents and have bonfires every night. We always go with my best friend Lexi and her family. I hope to continue the tradition with my own family one day.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have two dogs in my family. They are both toy poodles because my mom is allergic to fur and poodles have real hair. One is named Macy and she is one year old. The other one is named Trixie and she is 14 years old.
